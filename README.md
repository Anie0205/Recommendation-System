# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This repository contains code for a movie recommendation system implemented using machine learning techniques in a Google Colab notebook.

## Overview

The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and similarities to other users. The dataset used for training and testing the model is [provide dataset source if applicable].

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
    ```

2. Open `movie_recommendation_system.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to train the recommendation model and generate movie recommendations.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this project are as follows: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10P7C-suaBAA5_ZAi4oEO_Pmsb7kG6JMZ
Feel free to use your dataset to train the model

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced recommendation algorithms like content-based filtering or hybrid models.
- Enhance the user interface for better interaction and visualization of recommendations.
- Optimize the model for larger datasets and real-time usage.
